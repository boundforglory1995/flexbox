<h3>Buried In Verona</h3>
<p>Buried In Verona is an Australian metalcore band from Sydney, New South Wales, formed in 2006. As of 2014 they have released four full-length albums, the most recent being Faceless, released in March 2014.

The singer Brett Anderson has also featured in a song made by the Swedish band Solitude called "Last Division"</p>
<p>Early history (2007–2008)[edit]
Buried In Verona formed in 2007 by vocalist Brett Anderson, guitarists Mick Taylor and Katongo Chituta, bassist Scott Richmond and drummer Steve Rogers. All the members were aqcuainted through the high school community in the suburb of Engadine in south Sydney.[3] After a relatively short period of live performances, during which they gained support slots for Australian bands Daysend, Toe To Toe and Frankenbok,[4] the band released their debut album Circle The Dead in 2008. After the recording period in Melbourne, Steve Rogers was ejected from the group unceremoniously due to a serious back injury, which required surgery. Richie Newman, who co-produced the album along with Greg Stace, is credited as the drummer in the liner notes. Newman would later join the band officially as third guitarist. Chris Melross would eventually join the line-up as their drummer.

Buried in Verona has featured in the "Top 25 Bands to Look Out For" list in both the December 2009 and December 2010 editions of Blunt Magazine.[5]</p>
<p>Notorious and Faceless (2012–2014)[edit]
On 20 July 2011 Buried In Verona announced on their official Facebook page that they had parted ways with members Mick Taylor and Kat Chituta. Sean Gynn and Nate Martin were announced as their replacements. Newman openly admitted that the departure of these members meant the band was due for a change in musical style.[20] With the intention of returning to Sweden to record again with Fredrik Nordström, the band prepared for an Australian Farewell Tour with The Amity Affliction. On August 27, 2011, days before its commencement, another Facebook post simply stated "Our bass player is currently in RPA hospital, smashed himself through a glass window because he likes to party. Hope he's ok..."[21] Although never officially announced, Scott Richmond had been quickly replaced by Daniel Gynn on bass. With three founding members suddenly gone, Brett Anderson was left sole-remaining original member in the line-up.

Following the band's first European tour with Canada's Liferuiner, the band returned to Studio Fredman in Gothenburg, Sweden to begin a gruelling 3 month writing and recording process. Their third album, Notorious was released on 1 June 2012 following the band's signing to Australian label UNFD.[22] The band's stylistic change, moving away from the band's metalcore origins towards a stripped back, musically more diverse approach to songwriting, was praised by critics as a sign of maturity.[23][24][25][26][27][28] Anderson’s revised hardcore punk vocal style and Newman’s increased clean vocal presence was also duly noted.[29][30] The band featured The Amity Affliction's Ahren Stringer on the track "Can't Let It Go".

Expecting fan backlash, especially those who were more akin to their older metalcore style, Newman openly acknowledged the change, stating that the band’s attitude during the recording was "Fuck it. Write what you want to write, put your emotions into it and whatever happens happens. If you want to do something funky or jazzy or you think this part needs to be emotional or aggressive do whatever you want." [31] Having debuted on the ARIA Music Charts at #20[32] ‘’Notorious’’ was nominated for ‘’’Best Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Album’’’ at the annual ARIA Music Awards in 2012, but lost to DZ Deathrays ‘’Bloodstreams’’.[33] Returning to Australia in late June, the band began rigorous touring schedule.[34][35] In July, it was announced via Facebook that drummer Chris Melross had left the band and Shane O’Brien moved in as his replacement. In September 11, 2012 ‘’’Artery Recordings’’’ announced they had signed Buried In Verona for North American representation.[36] The band toured the U.S for the first time in November that year and again in 2013.
<br>

In February 2013, Buried In Verona have announced that Shane O’Brien had left the band to join I Killed The Prom Queen as their drum technician, and then their full time drummer, leaving the band without an official drummer.

In June 2013, Buried In Verona announced on their official Facebook page that drummer Conor Ward, would now be joining the band as their full-time drummer. Conor appeared in Buried In Verona's music video for their new song 'I Am Hate'. Buried In Verona toured with I Killed The Prom Queen, House Vs Hurricane (last tour), and Saviour on the 'East Coast Rampage Tour' across the east coast of Australia.[37][38] The band was set to record new music with Joey Sturgis in September.
<br>

On January 16, 2014, the band announced that their fourth studio album entitled Faceless would be released on March 7 through UNFD and Artery Recordings. Preorders were made available on January 23.

On January 12, 2015 Daniel and Sean Gynn announced their departure from the band on good terms, leaving the band as a three piece. Buried In Verona is scheduled to headline Shorefest in Sydney on April 18, 2015.
<br>
As of 18 April 2015, Conor Ward appears to have left the band, replacing him is ex-The Ocean The Sky drummer, James. Also replacing Daniel and Sean Gynn are ex-The Ocean The Sky vocalist Mark on Rhythm guitar and Brandon Martel De Fer on bass guitar. This line up is not yet officially announced.</p>
